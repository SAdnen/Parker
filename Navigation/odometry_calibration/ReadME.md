This is a ros package, clone it into your catkin_ws/src.
In this package we should make:
	 -A code that can control the velocity of each whell by aplyning a PID controller.
	 -Another code that commands the robot to move in a simple trajectory (square for example)
	 and then calibrates our parameters (radius of each wheel and the distance between the wheels)
	 to get a conforme behaviour.
